# 6. Accessing OmniDB

OmniDB comes only with the user *admin*. If you are using the server version,
the first thing to do is sign in as *admin*, the default password is *admin*.
You don't need to login in the app version.

If accessing for the first time, you will see the Welcome screen containing several
useful actions.

One of the most important features is accessible by clicking in the `Getting Started`
button or in the small OmniDB icon at the bottom right of the screen. It will start
`Omnis`, a helper that will guide you through the basics on the interface.
