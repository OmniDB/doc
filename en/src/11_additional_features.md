# Additional Features

#### SQL History

Every interaction the user does with every database is logged in OmniDB's *SQL
History*. To access it you need to click on the icon with an *H* on the upper
right corner. OmniDB will open an inner tab with all actions in a paginated
grid.

Each action shows date time it started, the time it ended, the duration, the
status and the command. As every grid in OmniDB, you can right click on the
command and click *View Content*, where another pop-up will open showing the
content in a larger text editor.

#### User Settings

Also in the upper right corner, by clicking in the gear-like icon, OmniDB will
open the *User Settings* pop-up. It is composed by two tabs:

- **User**: Allows the user to change its password. More user settings will be
added in the future.

- **Editor**: Allows the user to change the font size of the SQL Editor, and
also change the entire OmniDB theme. There are a lot of OmniDB themes, each of
them change the syntax highlight color of the editor. They are also categorized
in light and dark themes. A light theme is the default; a dark theme will change
the entire interface of OmniDB.

Every change in user settings require that you either:

- Refresh the page, if you are using OmniDB server and the interface through a
web browser; or
- Open and close OmniDB, if you are using OmniDB app.

#### Contextual Help

Most of tree nodes (generally grouping ones like *Schemas* or *Tables*) offer
contextual help. This feature can be accessed by right-clicking the tree node.
When you click in the *Doc: ...* option, OmniDB will open an inner tab showing
a web browser pointing to the specific page in the online **PostgreSQL
Documentation**. Also, it will redirect to the specific page considering the
PostgreSQL version you are connected to.
