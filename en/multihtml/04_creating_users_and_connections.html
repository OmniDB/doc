<h1 id="creating-users-and-connections">Creating Users and Connections</h1>
<h2 id="logging-in-as-user-admin">Logging in as user <em>admin</em></h2>
<p>OmniDB comes only with the user <em>admin</em>. If you are using the server version, the first thing to do is sign in as <em>admin</em>, the default password is <em>admin</em>. You don't need to login in the app version.</p>
<p><img src="../img/04_creating_users_and_connections_01.png" /></p>
<p>The next window is the <strong>Connections</strong> window. We will talk about it later.</p>
<p><img src="../img/04_creating_users_and_connections_02.png" /></p>
<h2 id="creating-another-user">Creating another user</h2>
<p>Click on the <em>Users</em> icon on the upper right corner. It will open a popup that allows the current OmniDB super user to create a new OmniDB user.</p>
<p><img src="../img/04_creating_users_and_connections_03.png" /></p>
<p>After clicking on the <em>Users</em> icon the tool inserts a new user called <em>user2</em> (if that is the first user after <em>admin</em>).</p>
<p><img src="../img/04_creating_users_and_connections_04.png" /></p>
<p>You will have to change the <em>username</em> and <em>password</em>. Check if you want this new user to be a <em>super user</em>. This user management window is only seem by super users. When you are done, click on the <em>Save Data</em> button inside the popup.</p>
<p><img src="../img/04_creating_users_and_connections_05.png" /></p>
<p>You can create as many users as you want, edit existing users and also delete users by clicking on the red cross at the actions column. Now you can logout.</p>
<h2 id="signing-in-as-the-new-user">Signing in as the new user</h2>
<p>Let us sign in as the user we just created.</p>
<p><img src="../img/04_creating_users_and_connections_06.png" /></p>
<p>And we can see the <strong>Connections</strong> window again. Note that now there is no <em>Users</em> icon, because the <em>test</em> user is not a super user.</p>

<h2 id="creating-connections">Creating connections</h2>
<p>OmniDB C# version supported several DBMS. At the moment, OmniDB Python version, or <code>OmniDB 2.0</code>, supports only PostgreSQL. More DBMS support is being added as you read this.</p>
<p>We will now create two connections to PostgreSQL databases. To create the connections you have to click on the button <em>New Connection</em> and then choose the connection and fill the other fields. After filling all the fields for both connections, click on the <em>Save Data</em> button.</p>
<p><img src="../img/04_creating_users_and_connections_08.png" /></p>
<p>For each connection there is an <em>Actions</em> column where you can delete, test and select them. Go ahead and test one of the connections.</p>
<p><img src="../img/04_creating_users_and_connections_09.png" /></p>
<p>Notice the <em>Password Expired</em> pop-up. This is happening because OmniDB does not store the database user password on disk. When the user types a password in this popup, the password is encrypted and stored in memory.</p>
<p>After you type the password and hit <em>Enter</em>, if the connection to the database is successful you will see a confirmation pop-up.</p>
<p><img src="../img/04_creating_users_and_connections_10.png" /></p>
<p>But, if you have trouble of any kind connecting to your PostgreSQL database, the <em>Password Expired</em> popup will remain showing the error OmniDB got.</p>
<p><img src="../img/04_creating_users_and_connections_11.png" /></p>
<p>Also, in the connections grid, if you click on the <em>Select Connection</em> action, OmniDB will open it in the <strong>Workspace Window</strong>.</p>
