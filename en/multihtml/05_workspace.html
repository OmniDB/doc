<h1 id="workspace">Workspace</h1>
<p>After creating at least one connection the user can enter the <em>Workspace</em>, either by clicking the <em>Workspace</em> tab or by clicking in the <em>Select Connection</em> action in the connections grid.</p>

<h2 id="sections-of-the-workspace-window">Sections of the <em>Workspace</em> window</h2>
<p>This interface has several elements:</p>
<p><img src="../img/05_workspace_02.png" /></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>1) Links</strong>: Enables the user to navigate between OmniDB windows</li>
<li><strong>2) Outer Tabs</strong>: OmniDB lets you work with several databases at the same time. Each database will be accessible through an <em>outer tab</em>. Outer tabs also can host miscellaneous features, like the <em>Snippets</em> feature</li>
<li><strong>3) Options</strong>: Shows the current user logged in, and also links for <em>user settings</em>, <em>query history</em>, <em>information</em> and <em>logout</em>.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="connection-outer-tab">Connection Outer Tab</h2>
<p>So, the outer table named <em>Test</em> has this name because of the alias we put in the connection to the <code>testdb</code>. This tab is a <em>Connection Outer Tab</em>. Notice the little tab with a cross besides the <em>Test</em> outer tab. This allows you to create a new outer tab that will automatically be a <em>Connection Outer Tab</em>. However, the <em>Snippet Outer Tab</em> is fixed and will always be the first.</p>
<p>A new <em>Connection Outer Tab</em> will always automatically point to the first connection on your list of database connections. Or, if you clicked on the <em>Select Connection</em> action, it will point to the selected connection. Observe the elements inside of this tab:</p>
<p><img src="../img/05_workspace_04.png" /></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>1) Connection Selector</strong>: Shows all connections and lets the user select the current one</li>
<li><strong>2) Tree of Structures</strong>: Displays a hierarchical tree where you can navigate through the database elements</li>
<li><strong>3) Inner Tabs</strong>: Allows the user to execute actions in the current database. There are several kinds of inner tabs for the current database. By clicking on the last small tab with a cross, you can add a new tab. A new tab always will be a <em>Query Tab</em>, where you can write any kind of SQL statement</li>
<li><strong>4) Inner Tab Content</strong>: Can vary depending on the kind of inner tab. The figure shows a <em>Query Tab</em> and in this case the content will be an <em>SQL Editor</em>, with syntax highlight and autocomplete</li>
<li><strong>5) Inner Tab Actions</strong>: Can vary depending on the kind of inner tab. For a <em>Query Tab</em>, they are <em>Execute Button</em>, <em>Format Button</em> and <em>Editor Mode</em> (script, execute or query)</li>
<li><strong>6) Inner Tab Results</strong>: A <em>Query Tab</em> in query mode, after you click in the <em>Execute Button</em> or type the execute shortcut (<code>Alt-Q</code>), will show a grid with the query results. All modes will show error messages, if any.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="working-with-databases">Working with databases</h2>
<p>Take a look at your connections selector. OmniDB always points to the first available connection but you can change it by clicking on the selector.</p>
<p><img src="../img/05_workspace_05.png" /></p>
<p>Select the <em>DellStore</em> connection. Now go to the tree right below the selector and click to expand the node <em>Schemas</em>.</p>
<p><img src="../img/05_workspace_06.png" /></p>
<p>Bear in mind that every 10 minutes you keep without performing actions on the database, will trigger a <em>Password Expired</em> popup. As explained before, this is important for your database security. After you type the correct password, you will see all schemas in your database (in case of PostgreSQL, <code>TOAST</code> and temp schemas are not shown).</p>
<p><img src="../img/05_workspace_07.png" /></p>
<p>Now click to expand the schema <code>public</code>. You will see different kinds of elements contained in this schema.</p>
<p><img src="../img/05_workspace_08.png" /></p>
<p>Now click to expand the node <em>Tables</em>, and you will see all tables contained in the schema <code>public</code>. Expand any table and you will see its columns, primary key, foreign keys, unique constraints and indexes. Each column is also expansible, displaying data type and nullable constraint.</p>
<p><img src="../img/05_workspace_09.png" /></p>
<p>In order to view records inside a table, right click it and choose <em>Data Actions &gt; Query Data</em>.</p>
<p><img src="../img/05_workspace_10.png" /></p>
<p>Notice that OmniDB fills the current SQL editor with a simple query to list table records. The records are displayed in a grid right below the editor. This grid can be controlled with keyboard as if you were using a spreadsheet manager. You can also copy data from single cells or block of cells (that can be selected with the keyboard or mouse) and paste on any spreadsheet manager.</p>
<p><img src="../img/05_workspace_11.png" /></p>
<p>You can edit the query on the SQL editor, writing simple or more complex queries and clicking on the action button. You can control how many records should be displayed (10, 100, 1000 or all rows). More details in the next chapters.</p>
<h2 id="working-with-multiple-tabs-inside-the-same-connection">Working with multiple tabs inside the same connection</h2>
<p>Inside a single connection, you can create several inner tabs by clicking on the last little tab with a cross. Each new inner tab will be a <em>Query Tab</em>.</p>
<p><img src="../img/05_workspace_12.png" /></p>
<p>On OmniDB, you can execute several SQL statements and procedures in parallel. When it is executing, an icon will be shown in the tab to indicate its current state. If some process is finished and it is not in the current tab, that tab will show a green icon indicating the routine being executed there is now finished.</p>
<p><img src="../img/05_workspace_13.png" /></p>
<p>By clicking in the <em>Cancel button</em>, you can cancel a process running inside the database.</p>
<p><img src="../img/05_workspace_14.png" /></p>
<p>You can also drag and drop a tab to change its order. This works with both inner and outer tabs.</p>
<p><img src="../img/05_workspace_15.png" /></p>
<p>Additionally, you can use keyboard shortcuts to manage inner tabs (SQL Query) and outer tabs (Connection):</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Ctrl-Insert</strong>: Insert a new inner tab</li>
<li><strong>Ctrl-Delete</strong>: Removes an inner tab</li>
<li><strong>Ctrl-&lt;</strong>: Change focus to inner tab at left</li>
<li><strong>Ctrl-&gt;</strong>: Change focus to inner tab at right</li>
<li><strong>Ctrl-Shift-Insert</strong>: Insert a new outer tab</li>
<li><strong>Ctrl-Shift-Delete</strong>: Removes an outer tab</li>
<li><strong>Ctrl-Shift-&lt;</strong>: Change focus to outer tab at left</li>
<li><strong>Ctrl-Shift-&gt;</strong>: Change focus to outer tab at right</li>
</ul>
