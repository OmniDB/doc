<h1 id="data-management">Data Management</h1>
<p>The tool allow us to edit records contained in tables through a very simple and intuitive interface. Given that only a few DBMS have unique identifiers for table records, we opted to allow data editing and removal only for tables that have primary keys. Tables that do not have it can only receive new records.</p>
<p>To access the record editing interface, right click the table node and select the action <em>Data Actions &gt; Edit Data</em>:</p>

<p>The interface has a SQL editor where you can filter and order records. To prevent that the interface requests too many records, there is a field that limits the number of records to be displayed. The records grid has column names and data types. Columns that belong to the primary key have a key icon next to their names.</p>
<p>The row of the grid that have the symbol <code>*</code> is the row to add new records. Let us insert some records in the table <code>Customer</code>:</p>

<p>After saving, the records will be inserted and can be edited (only because this table has a primary key). Let’s change the <em>cust_name</em> of some of the existing records:</p>

<p>Tables can have fields with values represented by very long strings. To help edit these fields, OmniDB has an interface that can be accessed by right clicking the specific cell:</p>

<p><img src="../img/07_data_management_06.png" /></p>
<p>The interface detects errors that may occur during operations related to records. To demonstrate, let us insert two records with existing <code>cust_id</code> (primary key):</p>
<p><img src="../img/07_data_management_07.png" /></p>
<p>It shows which commands tried to be executed and the respective errors.</p>
<p>To complete this chapter, let’s add some records to the <em>Address</em> table:</p>
