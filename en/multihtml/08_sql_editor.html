<h1 id="writing-sql-queries">Writing SQL Queries</h1>
<p>The tool comes with a tab system where each tab contains a SQL editor, an action button, an indent button, a field to select the type of command and a space to display the result.</p>
<p>The SQL editor has a feature that helps a lot when creating new queries: SQL code completion. With this feature it is possible to autocomplete columns contained in a table referenced by an alias. To open the autocomplete interface you just have to type the alias and then the dot character:</p>

<p>Besides autocompleting table columns the editor also searches for columns contained in subqueries:</p>

<p>The field to select the type of command has the following options:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Script</strong>: script execution, which is a sequence of commands separated by semicolon:</li>
</ul>
<p><img src="../img/08_sql_editor_03.png" /></p>
<p>The return shows the response time, the number of commands that were successfully executed, the number of commands that generated errors and a list displaying each error.</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Execute</strong>: execution of only one command. The return shows the response time or an error.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Query (10, 100, 1000, all) rows</strong>: execution of a query that returns a set of records, which are displayed on a grid. Just like in the record editing interface each cell can be visualized separately by right clicking it:</p></li>
</ul>
