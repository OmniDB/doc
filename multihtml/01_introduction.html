<h1 id="introduction">Introduction</h1>
<p><em>DBMS</em> stands for <em>database management system</em>. It may be a simple function library or even a larger system composed by several programs and processes running separately and in parallel, whose main function is to manage one or several databases hosted in a server. It has the responsibility to manipulate and to keep the consistency of data, allowing the software developers to focus on functionalities. Thus, practically any modern system that manages data utilizes some kind of DBMS, regardless of the amount of stored information.</p>
<p><strong>OmniDB</strong>’s first version was created as an undergrad final project in the Computer Science Course from the Federal University of Paraná. The objective was to trace a common line between popular DBMS, and to study deeply their <em>metadata</em>. The result was a tool capable of connecting and identifying the main structures (tables, keys, indexes and constraints), in a generic way, from several DBMS:</p>
<ul>
<li>Firebird</li>
<li>MariaDB / MySQL</li>
<li>Oracle</li>
<li>PostgreSQL</li>
<li>SQLite</li>
<li>Microsoft SQL Server</li>
</ul>
<p>Since early development, OmniDB was designed as an web app. Consequently, it runs in any browser, from any operational system. It can be accessed by several computers and multiple users, each one of them with his/her own group of connections. It also may host any operational system, without the need of install any dependencies. We will see further details on installation in the next chapters.</p>
<p>OmniDB’s main objective is to offer an unified workspace with all functionalities needed to manipulate different DMBS. DBMS specific tools aren’t required: in OmniDB, the context switch between different DBMS is done with a simple connection switch, without leaving the same page. The end-user’s sensation is that there is no difference when he/she manipulates different DBMS, it just feels like different connections.</p>
