<h2 id="logging-in-as-user-admin">Logging in as user <em>admin</em></h2>
<p>OmniDB comes only with the user <em>admin</em>. The first thing to do is sign in as admin, the default password is admin.</p>

<p class="caption">User management window</p>
</div>
<p>After clicking on the <em>New User</em> button the tool inserts a new user called <em>user2</em> (if that is the first user after <em>admin</em>).</p>
<div class="figure">

<p class="caption">Creating new user</p>
</div>
<p>You will have to change the <em>username</em> and <em>password</em>. Check if you want this new user to be a <em>super user</em>. This user management window is only seem by super users. When you are done, click on the <em>Save Data</em> button.</p>
<div class="figure">

<p>You can create as many users as you want, edit existing users and also delete users by clicking on the red cross at the actions column. Now you can logout.</p>
<h2 id="signing-in-as-the-new-user">Signing in as the new user</h2>
<p>Let us sign in as the user we just created.</p>

<p class="caption">Signing in as the new user</p>
</div>
<p>And we can see the <strong>Connections</strong> window again. Note that now there is no <em>Users</em> tab, because the <em>test</em> user is not a super user.</p>

<h2 id="creating-connections">Creating connections</h2>
<p>OmniDB C# version supported several DBMS. At the moment, OmniDB Python version, or <code>OmniDB 2.0</code>, supports only PostgreSQL. More DBMS support is being added as you read this.</p>
<p>We will now create two connections to PostgreSQL databases. To create the connections you have to click on the button <em>New Connection</em> and then choose the connection and fill the other fields. After filling all the fields for both connections, click on the <em>Save Data</em> button.</p>
<div class="figure">
<img src="../img/04_creating_users_and_connections_08.png" alt="Some connections created" />
<p class="caption">Some connections created</p>
</div>
<p>For each connection there is an <em>Actions</em> column where you can delete and test them. Go ahead and test one of the connections.</p>

</div>
<p>Notice the <em>Password Expired</em> popup. This is happening because OmniDB does not store the database user password on disk. When the user types a password in this popup, the password is encrypted and stored in memory.</p>
<p>After you type the password and hit <em>Enter</em>, if the connection to the database is successful you will see a confirmation popup.</p>
<div class="figure">
<img src="../img/04_creating_users_and_connections_10.png" alt="Connection successful" />
<p class="caption">Connection successful</p>
</div>
<p>But, if you have trouble of any kind connecting to your PostgreSQL database, the <em>Password Expired</em> popup will remain showing the error OmniDB got.</p>
