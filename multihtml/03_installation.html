<h1 id="installation">Installation</h1>
<p>OmniDB provides 2 kinds of packages to fit every user needs:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>OmniDB Application</strong>: Runs a web server on a random port behind, and provides a simplified web server window to use OmniDB interface without any additional setup. Just feels like a desktop application.</li>
<li><strong>OmniDB Server</strong>: Runs a web server on a random port. User needs to connect to it through a web browser. Provides user management, ideal to be hosted on a server on users' networks.</li>
</ul>
<p>Both application and server can be installed on the same machine.</p>
<h2 id="omnidb-application">OmniDB Application</h2>
<p>In order to run OmniDB app, you don't need to install any additional piece of software. Just head to <a href="omnidb.org" class="uri">omnidb.org</a> and download the latest package for your specific operating system and architecture:</p>
<ul>
<li>Linux 32 bits / 64 bits
<ul>
<li>DEB installer</li>
<li>RPM installer</li>
<li>Tarball</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Windows 32 bits / 64 bits
<ul>
<li>EXE installer</li>
<li>ZIP package</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Mac OSX
<ul>
<li>DMG installer</li>
<li>ZIP package</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<p>If you choose tarball or zip packages, just extract it somewhere in your computer. Get inside the folder it creates and run the <code>omnidb-app</code> executable. It will open OmniDB inside its own window.</p>
<p>With the installer you can install OmniDB in your system, and it will be available through your desktop environment application menu. When you launch it, OmniDB will open its own window.</p>

<h2 id="omnidb-server">OmniDB Server</h2>
<p>Like OmniDB app, OmniDB server doesn't require any additional piece of software and the same options for operating system and architecture are provided.</p>
<p>If you choose the tarball or zip package, extract it somewhere in your computer. Get inside the uncompressed folder and run the <code>omnidb-server</code> executable.</p>
<div class="sourceCode"><pre class="sourceCode bash"><code class="sourceCode bash"><span class="ex">user@machine</span>:~$ cd omnidb-server
<span class="ex">user@machine</span>:~/omnidb-server$ ./omnidb
<span class="ex">Starting</span> OmniDB 2.0.2 at http://localhost:8000
<span class="ex">Open</span> OmniDB in your favorite browser
<span class="ex">Press</span> Ctrl+C to exit</code></pre></div>
<p>If you installed OmniDB server with some installer option, you will need administrator privileges:</p>
<div class="sourceCode"><pre class="sourceCode bash"><code class="sourceCode bash"><span class="ex">user@machine</span>:~$ sudo omnidb-server
<span class="ex">Starting</span> OmniDB 2.0.2 at http://localhost:8000
<span class="ex">Open</span> OmniDB in your favorite browser
<span class="ex">Press</span> Ctrl+C to exit</code></pre></div>
<p>Now that the web server is running, you may access OmniDB web app on your favorite browser. Type in address bar: <code>localhost:8000</code> and hit <code>Enter</code>. If everything went fine, you shall see a page like this:</p>
